# ===== CUSTOM NAMES =====
# Custom names only work when the path itself is a git repository
# Use scan_depth = 0 for specific repos you want to name

# Example: If ~/Code/my-important-project/.git exists
[[paths]]
path = "~/Code/my-important-project"
name = "Main Project"  # Optional: Custom display name in the list
scan_depth = 0  # REQUIRED: Must be 0 for custom name to apply

[[paths]]
path = "~/Work/client-site"
name = "🚀 Client Website"  # You can even use emojis!
scan_depth = 0  # REQUIRED: Must be 0 for custom name to apply

# ===== IMPORTANT =====
# If you have a directory with MULTIPLE git repos inside:
# - Set scan_depth > 0 to find all repos
# - Custom name will NOT apply to subdirectories
# - Example: ~/Code/projects/ contains repo1/, repo2/, repo3/
[[paths]]
path = "~/Code/projects"
scan_depth = 2  # Finds repo1, repo2, repo3
# name = "..."  # This would NOT work - subdirectories have different paths

# If you want to name each subdirectory repo, add them individually:
[[paths]]
path = "~/Code/projects/repo1"
name = "Project One"
scan_depth = 0

[[paths]]
path = "~/Code/projects/repo2"
name = "Project Two"
scan_depth = 0

# This is used when scan_depth is set to -1 in path config
max_depth = 2

# Show hidden directories when scanning (directories starting with .)
# Note: .git directories are always skipped

# Default commit message for quick push (lowercase 'p' key)
# This message is used when you want to quickly commit and push without typing a message

# Set to 0 to disable auto-refresh (manual refresh only with 'r' key)
