# zebracal
TUI calendar app for syncing and editing local &amp; caldav calendars. Built with Go and the Bubbletea TUI Library.  


## Usage

start with `zebracal`. Basic controls are displayed in the bottom bar

## Config

Recommended to use with a caldav server (I use radicale). Local calendars or subscription through ics is also possible.

See the `default_config` for examples.
